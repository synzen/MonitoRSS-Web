    "a": "- Double check that the bot has permissions to read and send messages.\n- Ensure the all feed's articles are publicly accessible (for example, not in private forum sections)\n- Make sure any feed filters that you set are working as expected.\n- Wait at least 10 minutes for any new articles to be fetched, if there are any past the time of feed addition (which can be checked in a browser that beautifies the feed such as firefox, or a browser plugin).\n- Ensure your feed has the pubdate (published date) and `{date}` field in the `test` command filled out. If they don't exist, articles will be marked as old and won't be sent. You may bypass this by disabling date checks for a specific feed in `options`.\n- If date checks are turned on (which is default), make sure the `{date}`s are less than a day old.\n\nIf the issue still persists after **carefully reading the above points**, provide your server ID, feed URL, and what the expect article(s) were in the support server.",

To find a feed on a particular site, you can find an RSS icon, a link that alludes to getting updates, or just googling for it.
